403 Error connecting to localhost
=================================

When connecting to http://localhost on a WindowsXP version of IIS, you may see many **HTTP/403** errors.  This is caused by WindowsXP's 10 connection limit.  To reduce the incidence of this problem, ensure that **"Reuse Connections to Servers"** is checked in the **Tools | Fiddler Classic Options | Connections** dialog.
