SAZClipboard
============

Introduction
------------

The SAZClipboard is a simple extension that allows you to open a .SAZ file outside of the main Fiddler Classic UI.  You can then drag sessions between this clipboard from the Fiddler Classic UI.

Why would I want to do this?
----------------------------

This may be useful if you're using the Fiddler Classic Request Builder or AutoResponder features, both of which accept drops of Fiddler Classic sessions for reuse.

Usage Instructions
------------------

Open the SAZClipboard Window from the **Tools Menu**.

![Tools Menu Item][1]

You can drag and drop from the Fiddler Classic session list to the SAZ clipboard form, or load a SAZ directly into it using the button at the bottom. Launch it from the Tools menu. Just drop SazClipboard.dll into your C:\program files\fiddler2\scripts folder and restart Fiddler. Source is provided, so you can update as desired.
