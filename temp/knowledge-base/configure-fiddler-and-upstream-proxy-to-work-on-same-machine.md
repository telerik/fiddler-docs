## Description
In some cases, when using Fiddler Classic it may be necessary to allow traffic through to an upstream proxy. If this is needed, follow the below solution.

## Solution

1. Configure the OS Auto Proxy settings with a PAC file and with Fiddler's Proxy configuration.

2. Use a catch in the PAC file. 

    ```JavaScript
    function FindProxyForURL(url,host){

        // Catch specific URL
        if (shExpMatch(url,"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")){
            return "PROXY xxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
        }

        // Let other URLs use fiddler
        return "PROXY localhost:8888";
    }
    ```

3. Start Fiddler Classic with -noattach flag.

    ```CMD
    fiddler.exe -noattach
    ```

4. Set Fiddler Classic Gateway Options to No Proxy to prevent infinite loop.
