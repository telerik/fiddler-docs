# Capture Traffic from a Different Account

To capture traffic from accounts other than the current user (for example, ASP.NET on IIS or a Windows Service), configure that process to use the Fiddler Classic proxy.

For example:

[Configure .NET Applications](slug://ConfigureDotNETApp)
[Configure WinHTTP Applications](slug://ConfigureWinHTTPApp)
