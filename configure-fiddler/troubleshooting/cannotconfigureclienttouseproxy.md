Problem: Cannot Configure Client to Use Proxy Server
----------------------------------------------------

The client device, application or platform has no option to use a proxy server like Fiddler. This is preventing capture of web traffic from the application.

Solution: 
---------

[Configure Fiddler Classic as a Reverse Proxy][1]

[1]: ../Tasks/UseFiddlerAsReverseProxy
