  >tip Note that newer Firefox versions already respect the system proxy by default (**Use system proxy settings** is selected by default). Use the manual configuration only if you need to capture Firefox traffic only and you would like to avoid polluting the captured sessions with system traffic.

  - Option 1. Instruct Firefox to trust added CA (Windows only).

    1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` 

    1. Toggle the `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` setting to `true`.
