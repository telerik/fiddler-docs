User Interface Guide
====================

Overview

![UI Overview](../images/UIGuide/UIOverview.png)

The Web Sessions List
---------------------

The Web Sessions list contains the list of HTTP Requests that are sent by your computer.  You can resize and reorder the columns in this list for your convenience.  You can also sort this list by clicking on the column header.

Certain key information is available in this list, including:

+ # - An ID# of the request generated by Fiddler Classic for your convenience
+ Result - The Result code from the HTTP Response.  
+ Protocol - The Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS/FTP) used by this session
+ Host - The hostname of the server to which the request was sent
+ URL - The path and file requested from the server
+ Body - The number of bytes in the Response body
+ Caching - Values from the Response's Expires or Cache-Control headers
+ Process - The local Windows Process from which the traffic originated
+ Content-Type - The Content-Type header from the Response
+ Custom - A text field you can set [via scripting](slug://slug AddColumns).
+ Comments - A text field you can set from scripting or the session's context menu

In Fiddler Classic v2.2.0.5 and later, you can add new columns of your choice.

The default text coloring of the Session entries derives from the HTTP Status (red for errors, yellow for authentication demands), traffic type (CONNECT appears in grey), or response type (CSS in purple, HTML in blue; script in green, images in grey).  You can override a session's text color using the ui-color flag in FiddlerScript.

Each session is marked with an icon for quick reference:

Request Composer
----------------

The [Request Composer](slug://slug CreateNewRequest) allows you to craft custom requests to send to the server.  You can either create a new request manually, or you can drag and drop a session from the Web Sessions list to create a new request based on the existing request. Learn more...
