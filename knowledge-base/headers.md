Headers References
--------------

This article lists several popular references for HTTP headers. We also explain some of the [frequently misinterpreted HTTP headers](#additional-Information).

References for HTTP Response Status codes: 
+ [RFC 2616 List][1] or [Expanded Wikipedia List][2]
+ [HTTP RFC Header Definitions][3]
+ [IANA Header Registrations][4]
+ [Jukka Korpela's list of HTTP Headers][5]

Additional Information
----------------------

Following are some remarks on a few of the HTTP headers that are often misunderstood.



**Expires**

Date the response expires and should no longer be used by a cache.  See [http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/][6] or pg 183.  Note that this header should be overruled by the Cache-Control header in a HTTP1.1 client.



**Cache-Control: must-revalidate**	

Note that the O'Reilly book (and many other places, including IE) implement this incorrectly! See [http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/][6] or [RFC2616][7].



**P3P**	

Compact P3P Privacy statement.  See [http://www.p3pwriter.com/LRN_111.asp][8] for a description of the token meanings.  See also [Info on IE6's Privacy features and impact on HTTP Cookies][9].



**Set-Cookie**
