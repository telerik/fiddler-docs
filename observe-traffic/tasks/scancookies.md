 Fiddler Classic will gain a new top-level menu named **Privacy**.

2. Ensure **Privacy > Enabled** is checked.

 The add-on will add a **Privacy Info** column to the session list and will flag HTTP/HTTPS responses which set cookies. 

Evaluation of any P3P statements that come along with those cookies will change the session's background color:

+ **Green** sessions send a satisfactory P3P policy.
+ **Yellow** sessions set a cookie without a P3P policy.
+ **Orange** sessions send a P3P policy that [does not permit use of the cookie in a 3rd party context](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms537343(v=vs.85).aspx#unsatisfactory_cookies).
+ **Red** sessions send invalid P3P policies.
